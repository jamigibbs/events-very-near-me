Because Python is much easier to get started and master compared to languages like C++ or C. Python is also used extensively in Data Analysis, Machine Learning and AI - areas that are growing at an astonishing pace. This explains why Python developers are one of the most sought after today and are one of the best-paid software engineers, earning over $100,000 annually! There are literally thousands of job posts that go unanswered because there is a shortage of skilled Python developers. So, we believe that the future for skilled Python developers is bright and secured. And even if you don’t go into these areas, you can use Python for other purposes like building Desktop Apps. Did you know that Dropbox’s desktop app was built using Python? In short, Python is like the Swiss army knife of programming languages. You can use it even if you don’t work as a software engineer or a scientist. For example, if you are an entrepreneur or a marketer, you can use Python to analyze your data, and make data driven decisions which would give you the edge over your competitors. What&#39;s included in the course? Please note that this is an online course (To purchase the presale of the course or view the 10+ preview of the video course please go to our website - https://goo.gl/VyfWsq - or you can also purchase on eventbrite) When we were deciding on what to include in the course, we wanted to address the problems that we faced when we were learning Python. So here’s what you get when you order the course today: First, you get 80 percent off the retail price of $199.95 when you purchase the course at presale. That’s a savings of $160! Next, we have over 70 HD Video Lessons in this course. Each of our lessons are short, mostly less than 3 minutes, and really easy to digest. We understand that a lot of us are busy professionals and do not have hours each day to learn something, so we wanted to ensure that even if you only have a few minutes every day, you can still learn something from the course. In fact, if you can only spare 10 minutes each day, you can pretty much finish watching the videos in less than three weeks. Also, we transcribed our videos into downloadable PDFs so you can easily refer to them. We also included quizzes and coding practices at the end of most of our video lessons to test your understanding and reinforces the concepts that you just learnt. In this way, you would remember what you just learned longer, and you also become more confident and better at coding as you progress in the course. We also made some of the video lessons and the content to be covered in the course available, so you can check them out to see if the course is what you are looking for. Plus, we have a 30 days money-back guarantee, so in the unlikely event that you are not happy with the course, we would refund you the money within 30 days of the course release date. And lastly, we have also made ourselves available for you to talk to. We always dreamt of having someone we could talked to or ask when we were learning Python. And maybe you do too. So, if you have any questions or stuck at some part in the course, you can send an email to us and we would be happy to help you out. When will the course be released? The course would be out on mid-January to end-January onwards. Our supporters would receive an email informing them that the course is available once the course is released.

When we just started, we felt extremely frustrated because the books and tutorial made it really for a beginner to learn programming. Some of these books contained so many terminologies and unnecessarily long passages. So, it took us extremely long just to understand what the author was trying to say. Whenever we read these books, we really felt like giving up halfway. At first, we thought that we just weren’t that smart. But after talking to other developers, we realized that most of us had faced the same issue when we were just starting out. Hmm… could it be that programming was reserved for the SUPER SMART people? Nah, it couldn’t be. Some of these developers we were talking to held top positions at the leading technology companies in the world. Or could it be that the authors and lecturers just weren’t that great at teaching? Maybe. But we weren’t really sure. So, we looked into it. We began asking ourselves what were the terrible experiences we had when learning how to program and what could be done better. This was what we found. Problems in existing books and courses: Most authors and course creators aren’t succinct in their books or courses. This meant that as students, we had to spend hours just to learn a few concepts. And for many of us, who are either working or studying, it takes EXTREME dedication to do that each day after a long day at work or school. This explains why most of us give up within the first few days. A lot of video tutorials do not have accompanying notes. So, if we wanted to refer to something in the course, we had to spend a long time rewinding and rewatching the videos. Often, video courses do not have a preview for us to look at. This meant that when we are looking to learn a new course, it’s based on recommendations from other users or a friend or sometimes even based on our gut instinct. And that might not always work out. But since most courses don’t have any refund policies, if we were to buy a course that we don’t like, we are pretty much stuck with it. How many times have you read through an entire book or watched a course, thinking you understood everything, but when you couldn’t even recall the concepts in the last chapter when someone asked you about it? We know we have. Countless times. And that’s because studies have shown that just reading or watching something, even multiple times, do not improve long-term retention. Lastly, for most of us learning from books and online courses, there wasn’t anyone we could ask if we didn’t understand something. And we wanted to change all that. Frequently Asked Questions: I have no coding experience at all. Will this course help me? This course is aimed at any person who wishes to learn the fundamentals of Python, whether you are completely new to coding or have experience in other languages. In this course, we teach you Python in a step-by-step process through video lessons, notes, quizzes and interactive coding practices. The video lessons and notes helps you understand Python in a simple and intuitive way while the quizzes and exercises helps to reinforce the concepts you learned from the video lessons. How long can I access the course for? You can access this course forever! Plus, whenever we create new materials or have any updates to the course, you can access them for free too! What if I don’t like the course or learn anything useful from it? We have a 30-day guarantee for our course. In the unlikely event that you are unhappy with the course, we would refund your money within 30 days of the course release date or within 30 days of your purchase date (for buyers who purchased the course after it’s released). Will you be available if I am stuck or need feedback? Of course! If you have any questions or you are stuck at some parts, you can send an email to contact@diffusion.academy and we would be happy to help you out.

We begin with one of Chicago&#39;s most iconic foods and one that sets us apart from New York: deep dish pizza. A marvel of both flavor and engineering it&#39;s built &quot;upside down&quot; because it takes 45 minutes to bake. Next we head to one of the oldest bars in &quot;The Loop.&quot; We will experience the culinary influence of the Polish & German immigrants. We next head up to the Winter Garden, located in the Harold P. Washington Library. Here we begin a wide-ranging historical and architectural introduction to one of the most important U.S. cities. Chicago&#39;s public works of art are from some of the most renowned artists of the 20th century: including, Miro, Picasso, Calder, and Chagall. We&#39;ll pass Alexander Calder&#39;s Flamingo, as we discuss Chicago&#39;s most famous mayor and the legacy of public art he left behind. Next up, a sweet treat beloved by Chicagoans and visitors alike. Next, Chicago&#39;s oldest Italian restaurant. We will have the traditional Italian Beef Sandwich. There are many ways to order a beef, but only one way for locals: sweet, hot, and dipped. As our journey continues, we head into the extravagant lobby of one of the few &quot;Historic Hotels of America.&quot; Then we&#39;ll have desert (our secret dish) with a view. Break out your cameras for the next leg of our journey through Millennium Park. We have several selfie-worthy stops, including the iconic reflective &quot;Cloud Gate&quot; sculpture, commonly known as &#39;The Bean.&#39; Please note: the itinerary is subject to change, based on the locations availability and weather.

If you&#39;re looking for a coach who isn&#39;t satisfied until you&#39;ve fully internalized what you&#39;ve been taught look no further. I now view my relationships with the women in my life through the lens of an actualized man who knows his true worth. This shift in perspective and attitude wouldn&#39;t have been possible without the time I spent working with Will. Thanks, bro! Leo Will is a great coach who has definitely improved my skill set with personal development and also with game. Before I received coaching from Will, I was not confident and had a huge amount of approach anxiety that I could not even compliment a woman properly. With his coaching, Will was able to teach me the tips, strategies, and mindset on how to approach women successfully. Jonathan I appreciated Will&#39;s level of engagement and desire to understand what I wanted, and what I needed. He was able to detect my weakpoints with frightening accuracy. What separates Will from other instructors is that he understands how people exhibit healthy masculinity, and how to tap into it. Will took me someone, who was terrified about approaching a girl during the day, to being absolutely excited and enthralled by the prospect.

These videos and just working with you over the past few months has really pushed me to investigate my thoughts on a regular basis. I don&#39;t think that I have ever been this mindful of my belief system and how it operates. I finally TRULY understand how powerful our thoughts can be, but also how simple it can be to take charge and change your life. (If you&#39;re ready) The information was really inspiring, uplifting and motivational. The videos were light-hearted, fast moving and a lot of fun to watch/listen to. This masterclass is good for any woman who wants to be empowered and take control of her life! It is for folks who are stuck in unhealthy thought patterns and people who keep hitting walls in their lives, whether it be their romantic lives, their professional lives or their personal lives. I think this material is also good for anyone who is on a spiritual journey and wants to understand the link between spirituality and love. This is for anyone who is willing to take a critical and deep look at their behavior and is ready for a new way to be in the world; A way that will bring them peace, harmony and empowerment. Says Christine: I started your program on Sunday and was asked out on a date by that night. I was then asked out by another man the next day and another last night! I have a date tonight, Thursday and Friday! Wow! Just last week I was thinking to myself in frustration that I should be going on at least three dates every week with many men asking me out. Then here I am this week and it&#39;s happening. This is SO fun!!  The way I&#39;ve always known in my heart it should be for a beautiful, intelligent young woman like myself. Thank you so very much from the bottom of my heart for putting yourself and your work out there for others to utilize and benefit from! I&#39;m excited to see what happens next.  Says Chelsie: This is great. If only more women knew how to BE the prize. It would solve so many relationship issues. Thanks for this! Says Susan: You make this all seem so easy. I always thought dating was so hard and I had to learn how to ‘play the game.’ But not anymore! Following your advice, I have not 1, not 2, but 3 dates lined up this weekend with high-quality men! Says Corie:  I&#39;m now dating the most amazing man! Thanks to you! Says Sheila: Woah! I walk down the street and notice that many heads are turning as I walk by! This truly is amazing! Says Jackie: This all makes perfect sense to me, now. I see how I was the one preventing myself from attracting in my prince charming. No more toads for me! Says Emilie: Everything I read from you makes so much sense! You have provided the missing pieces and NOW I fully feel armed to make the right choices in regards to love. I MIGHT NOT HAVE STRESSED ENOUGH JUST HOW IMPORTANT IT IS THAT YOU SHOULD SIGN UP NOW! You&#39;ll be doing yourself a favor in terms of your (future or current!) relationship by adding this knowledge to your life. But you have to MOVE FAST. You’re already most of the way there! If you’re still searching for the perfect man, time is wasting! You’re not getting any younger! The longer you sit there thinking about it... the more fears will creep in and you’ll talk yourself out of it….and you’ll be doomed to continue the same pattern of your past.

I had more from these past 7 weeks then any of my previous partners. He&#39;s loving, kind, gentle, beautiful human and we are so so so in love. There is something very divine around our connection and words are an understatement.I write this not to be bold but to let you know that ALL IS POSSIBLE for you, all is here when you trust to open your hearts and dare to dream beyond what you perceive in the present moment.&quot; -Zoe, the U.K. &quot;Sorry I’ve been out of contact Emyrald.

Responsive Advisors is committed to a holistic approach to agility and Scrum. Robert Pieper, a Professional Scrum Trainer with Scrum.org, is the founder and Principal Consultant of Responsive Advisors. Learn more about what makes Responsive Advisors Agile Training great. Our advisors help make Scrum stick by fully explaining the “why” behind Scrum (we don&#39;t just throw charts and graphs at you).  We have deep and broad industry experience and can uniquely apply it to real-world problems. We address the sticky issues of interpersonal communication and team dynamics. We find that many Scrum problems are actually people problems. We know how to communicate difficult-to-grasp agile concepts to technical and non-technical audiences alike. WHAT THEY&#39;RE SAYING ABOUT OUR INSTRUCTORS  &quot;Jordan was able to give me the holistic view of Scrum that I was missing even after working with it for years and having attended other training. I left the class excited and confident in my abilities, which is something that I can’t say that I’ve often experienced after a training class. I suppose the truest endorsement of the progress I made was finally having the confidence to take the PSM-II, which I passed with a 92%. If I wind up conquering the PSM-III, I know I’ll have Jordan to thank.” - David de Corlieu “Thank you again for a great class last week!  I came back excited to share what I&#39;d learned with the rest of the company - I&#39;d argue that&#39;s not something that can&#39;t be said for most classes. Loved the small class size and open communication. Would definitely recommend to others at my organization.”  “A good balance between theory and examples vague enough to elicit great discussion and interactions, but relevant enough to get concrete knowledge to take home.”  “Busting some of the myths of what is and isn’t scrum was helpful. Lots of good guidance on how to maximize our use of Scrum. Good clarification on the purpose of many of the Scrum concepts.”  MEET OUR INSTRUCTORS Robb Pieper is Principal Consultant and founder of Responsive Advisors, a management consulting firm focused on holistically improving organizations. He’s a Scrum.org certified trainer and coach having taught agility to thousands of people across the country. Robb solves problems often ignored in the agile community, like teaching managers how to work with agile teams and individuals how to work with their teammates on a human level. Robb knows that agility is a business problem, not just a software problem. Robb applies his passion and diverse background to building amazing cultures and learning organizations. Jordan Job is Managing Consultant at Responsive Advisors, a management consulting firm focused on holistically improving organizations. He’s a Scrum.org certified trainer and coach having taught agility to thousands of people across the country. When Jordan Job was a software developer, he quickly realized that almost all of the problems he faced in the workplace were not software problems but process, structure, and people problems. Since then, Jordan has been passionate about helping people become more satisfied and productive at work by improving the processes, structures, and relationships that surround them.  SOME OF OUR RECENT TRAINING CLIENTS WHO SHOULD ATTEND?

New equipment is more efficient that ever but due to this they also remove humidity very differently. The new technology of these units combined with how tight homes are becoming creates big issues when it comes to proper sizing and offering the correct recommendations to remediate any concerns. How to manage it in can be challenging, so we will learn different approaches and strategies to meet the ever-growing need. Aside from humidity, VOC&#39;s are becoming a major issue and proper ventilation is an important step in creating a healthier home. We will dive deep into both the proper humidity and ventilation for any home, the effects of each on the home and what equipment or tools are necessary to resolve any issues. This class is designed for anyone wanting to understand more on home performance and how to deal with all of these issues. What You Will Learn Psychrometrics Ventilation standards VOC control and monitoring systems Dehumidification equipment and sizing IAQ problems and health effects Summer and winter moisture issues Dirty ducts and health effects   This course qualifies for 8 BPI CEU&#39;s and 16 NATE CEU&#39;s.
